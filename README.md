I'm a back-end developer with a love for game development. All of my projects are created from scratch, from the initial planning and design stages through the use of code to address practical issues.I enjoy coming up with innovative answers to issues and putting them into practice to build well-designed, useful apps while also making sure that my knowledge and abilities are still relevant and useful.
